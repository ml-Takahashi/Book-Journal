## Book Journal Frontend

This project scaffolds a modern React + TypeScript interface for capturing book notes by genre. It ships with a sample library, fluid layout, and dialogs to add genres, record new books, and edit the table of contents for each title. Data lives purely in the browser for nowâ€”perfect for rapid iteration before connecting to a backend.

### Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed in the terminal (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`) to explore the app. The development server supports hot module reloading, so UI changes appear instantly.

### Core Features

- Nested genre sidebar with live book counts and quick add actions
- Searchable book gallery with elegant cards and accent colours
- Detail workspace for rich notes, tag management, and custom table-of-contents sections
- Reusable modal system for adding books and genres

Since the state is in-memory, refreshing the browser resets to the seeded demo catalogue. This keeps the experience lightweight while you iterate on backend choices.
